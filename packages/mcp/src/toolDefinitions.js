		'Create a fresh local in-process EVM. Use this before compiling, deploying, or testing contracts without a fork. Returns an isolated session handle.',

		'Fork an EVM chain from a public HTTP RPC URL, optionally at an exact block. Use this to inspect or modify real mainnet, Optimism, or Base state locally. Returns an isolated session handle.',
	evm_close_session:
		'Close an EVM session when its state is no longer needed. Use this to release memory before creating more sessions.',
	evm_call_contract:
		'Read a contract without changing state. Use an ABI or one human-readable function signature. Returns decoded output, exact gas use, raw output, and logs.',
	evm_send_transaction:
		'Execute a state-changing contract function and add it to the session txpool. Use evm_mine afterward to commit it. Returns decoded output, gas use, logs, and transaction hash.',
	evm_deploy_contract:
		'Deploy EVM bytecode or compile and deploy Solidity source into a session. The deployment enters the txpool, so use evm_mine to commit it. Returns the created address, gas use, and transaction hash.',

		'Inspect account balance, nonce, code, and an optional exact storage slot. Use this for debugging local overrides or reading forked contract storage.',
	evm_set_account:
		'Directly overwrite balance, nonce, code, or storage without a transaction. Use this cheatcode surface to construct otherwise difficult debugging states.',

		'Mine pending transactions and advance time in an EVM session. Use after writes or deployments, or to test block-dependent behavior.',

		'Query the latest block or a block by number or hash from an EVM session. Optionally include full transactions.',
	evm_get_transaction_receipt:
		'Fetch a mined transaction receipt by hash. Use after evm_mine to verify status, gas, logs, and contract creation.',
	evm_get_txpool:
		'Inspect pending and queued transactions plus txpool counts. Use before mining to reason about writes waiting for inclusion.',
	evm_trace_call:
		'Trace a contract call at opcode-step level. Use for control-flow and gas debugging, including calls that revert: a failing call still returns its trace plus the decoded error instead of throwing. The trace returns a bounded head and tail so it remains useful in an agent context window.',
	evm_compile_solidity:
		'Compile one Solidity source file to ABI, creation bytecode, and runtime bytecode. Use this before deployment or when starting from a contract snippet.',
